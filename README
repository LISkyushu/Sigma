
The code here is made publicly available for the research article "Self-Organizing to Learn Dynamical Hierarchies"
Refer to the article for details on the Sigma and the experiments performed.

Usage example

To reproduce the experiment results, run:
$python main.py
$python TP_matrix_clustering.py

If the parameter "movie" is set to true and "map dimension" is 2 or 3, movies of the dynamic of Sigma will be generated and saved in "movies_output" in MP4.
If the parameter "verbose" is set to 1 or 2, experiment results will be saved in "result" Excel (xlsx).

problem_index refers to the environments:

	IH: Imbalanced Hierarchy
	HB: Hierarchy with Branches
	IEH: Imbalanced with Extra Hierarchy
	DIH: Dynamic Imbalanced Hierarchy
	DCH: Dynamic Chunk Hierarchy
	EC2EH: Extra Chunk to Extra Hierarchy
	EH2EC: Extra Hierarchy to Extra Chunk
	DCS: Dynamic Chunk Swap
